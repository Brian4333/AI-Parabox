## Game Description

Why IA Parabox?

The Midjourney AI helped us create the graphical universe, and we wanted ChatGPT3 to design the game levels, but unfortunately, it failed in its task.

It is an 11-level Sokoban-like game. The rules are simple: move the player using the arrow keys. The player can move one or several blocks as long as they are not blocked by a wall.
You complete the level when all targets are covered by the player or a block.
How to move? Use the arrow keys.
Made a move that blocked you? Use Ctrl+Z to undo.
Want to see the contents of the block-world? Click on it.
Want to move to a specific square? Click on the square.
Want to restart the level? Press R.
